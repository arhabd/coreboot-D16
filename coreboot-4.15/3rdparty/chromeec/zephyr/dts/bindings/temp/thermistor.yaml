# Common properties for thermistors

properties:
  adc:
    required: true
    type: phandle
    description: named-adc child node connected to the thermistor

  get-temp-func:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: >
      Name of the board-provided function which reads the temperature. If you
      have different values and need to add a new function, you can add that
      here.

      The name is get_temp_<v>_<rs>_<rn>_<b>:

      v: voltage of resistor-divider circuit
      rs: value of the resistor that is in series with the thermistor
      rn: nominal resistance of thermistor at 25C
      b: B value for temperature range 25C to 100C

      See https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/io/thermistors.html for more
      information.
